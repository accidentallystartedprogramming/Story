Rohit Sharma is the greatest ODI batsman of all time. No one even comes close to him, he's just beyond stats
The one I talked about in the previous story, the person who I glaze tremendously, and it's rightly deserved, is none other than Virat "The Run Machine" Kohli
He's the greatest all format batsman to ever grace a cricket field. He is a cricketing genius. Be it ODI, be it t20, be it Test.
This guy is just the greatest in every single format, and there's no competition other than GOD himself. So yeah, undoubtedly, he is the GOAT of cricket
